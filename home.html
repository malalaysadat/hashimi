         <h1>Technology</h1>
         <p>is the application of conceptual knowledge for achieving practical goals
            especially in a reproducible way.the word Technology can also meam the
            products resulting from such as utensils or machines, and intangible ones
            such as sofware Technology plays a critical role in science,
            engineer,and everyday life.
            Technology advancements have led to significant changes in society.
            the earliest know Technology is the stone tool used during prehistoric time folloed by yhe 
            control of fire,which contributed to the growth of the human brain and the development 
            of languge during yhe lce age.The invention of the wheel in the Bronz Age allowed greater travel
            and the creation of more complex machines.More recent Technology inventions, and the Internet, have
            lowered barriers to communication and ushered in the knowledge ecoonomy.
            while Technology contributes to economic development and improves human prosperity,
            it can also have negative impacts like pollution and resource depletion, and can 
            cause social harms like Technology unemployment resulting from automation.as a result, there
            are ongoing philosophical and political debates about the role and use of Technology the ethics
            of Technology,and waysbto mitigate its downsides.
            <p>tools were initially development by hominids through observation and trial and error
                Around 2 Mya (million years ago), they learned to make the first stone tools by
                hammeriring flakes off a pebble, forming a sharp hand axe. This practice
                was refined 75 Kya (thousand years ago) into pressure flaking, enabling much finer work
                The discovery of fire was described by charles Darwin as possibly the greatest ever
                made by man. Man Archaeological,dietary, and social evidence point to "continuus[human] fire-use"
                at least 1.5 Mya. fire,fueled with wood and charcoal,allowed early humans to cook their food to increase
                its digestibility, improving its nutrient value and broadening the number of foods that could be eaten
                the cooking hypothesis proposes that the ability to cook promoted an increase in hominid brain 
                size,though some researchers find the evidence inconclusive.
                <P>Archaeological evidence of hearths was dated to 790 Kya; researchers believe this is likely
                    to have intensified human socialization and may have contributed to the emergence of languge
